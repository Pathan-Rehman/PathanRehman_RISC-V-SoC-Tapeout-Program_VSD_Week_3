Welcome to Week 3 of my digital design verification journey. In this section, I explore essential industry practices that are critical after the synthesis stage, focusing on Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) and Static Timing Analysis (STA).

This week is all about strengthening design reliability. I start with gate-level simulation to verify that the synthesized logic works correctly and accurately reflects real hardware behavior. Then, I dive into static timing analysis, where I check if all parts of my design meet required timing constraints to guarantee proper circuit operation at the desired clock speed.

If you’re interested in how real-world chip designs are validated beyond code, this week’s content demonstrates practical, hands-on approaches to ensuring both functional correctness and timing closure before fabrication.
